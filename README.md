# CarPrice_prediction_main

Overview:
I developed a machine learning model using Python to predict car prices based on a dataset containing relevant features. This project involved leveraging various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning algorithms.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Web Framework: Streamlit

Data:
  - The project initiated with the importation of a CSV dataset using Pandas, serving as the foundation for the machine learning model.
  - I declared variables pertinent to the prediction task, considering features like car make, model, year, mileage, etc.
  - Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for the machine learning model.

Model Development:

The core of the project involved training a machine learning model using the Scikit-learn library. Logistic regression was employed for predicting car prices based on the provided features.To gain insights into the data and model performance, I utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations. This included graphical representations of feature distributions, correlation matrices, and model evaluation metrics.


Usage Instructions:
To use the model, users need to install Streamlit. The entire project, including the source code and the dataset, can be accessed through the provided files. Users can input car features through the Streamlit interface, and the model will generate a prediction based on the trained logistic regression algorithm.

Conclusion:

- Streamlit Integration:
- For user-friendly interaction, I integrated the model with the Streamlit web framework to create a user interface. Users can input car features through the Streamlit interface, receiving real-time predictions.
- Prediction:
- The model, post-training, accurately predicts car prices based on specific input parameters.
