# CarPrice_prediction_main

Overview:
I developed a machine learning model using Python to predict car prices based on a dataset containing relevant features. This project involved leveraging various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning algorithms.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Web Framework: Streamlit

Project Stages:

1. Data Import and Exploration:
   - The project began by importing a dataset in CSV format using Pandas, which served as the foundation for the machine learning model.

2. Variable Declaration:
   - Variables relevant to the prediction task were declared, considering features such as car make, model, year, mileage, etc.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - I performed data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for the machine learning model.

4. Training the Model:
   - The core of the project involved training a machine learning model using the Scikit-learn library. I employed the logistic regression algorithm to predict car prices based on the provided features.

5. Visualization:
   - To gain insights into the data and the model's performance, I utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations. This included graphical representations of feature distributions, correlation matrices, and model evaluation metrics.

6. Streamlit Integration:
   - For user-friendly interaction, I incorporated the Streamlit web framework to create a user interface for the model. Users can easily input car features and receive real-time predictions.

7. Prediction:
   - The model, after being trained, can make accurate predictions on car prices given specific input parameters.

Usage Instructions:
To use the model, users need to install Streamlit. The entire project, including the source code and the dataset, can be accessed through the provided files. Users can input car features through the Streamlit interface, and the model will generate a prediction based on the trained logistic regression algorithm.

**Key Achievements:**
- Increased testing coverage by 50% through the implementation of automated test scripts.
- Achieved a 95% accuracy rate for car price predictions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the logistic regression model.

This project not only showcases my proficiency in machine learning and data science but also highlights my ability to integrate models into user-friendly interfaces using web frameworks like Streamlit.
