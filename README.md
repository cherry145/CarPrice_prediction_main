# CarPrice_prediction_main
I developed a car price prediction model using Python, leveraging key libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn's Linear Regression for modeling. Additionally, I implemented Streamlit for creating an interactive web interface to showcase the model's predictions.
